## Clinical Workflow Accuracy Improvements

### 1. Intelligent Lab Panel Selection

**Clinical Decision Logic:**
```python
def determine_lab_panels(patient, conditions):
    if condition_name == "Diabetes":
        panels.add("Diabetes_Monitoring")
        panels.add("Basic_Metabolic_Panel")
        panels.add("Lipid_Panel")
    elif condition_name in ["Heart Disease", "Hypertension"]:
        panels.add("Lipid_Panel")
        panels.add("Cardiac_Markers")
```

**Result**: Diabetic patients automatically get HbA1c, lipid panels, and kidney function monitoring.

### 2. Realistic Value Distribution

**Statistical Modeling:**
- **85% Normal Values**: Within reference range
- **10% Slightly Abnormal**: Outside range but not critical
- **5% Significantly Abnormal**: Including critical values

**Clinical Impact**: Mirrors real laboratory value distributions seen in clinical practice.

### 3. Procedure-Condition Relationships

**Evidence-Based Selection:**
- **Complexity-based probability**: Routine procedures more likely than high-risk
- **Age-adjusted outcomes**: Elderly patients have higher complication rates
- **Gender-appropriate screening**: No mammograms for males, no prostate screening for females
