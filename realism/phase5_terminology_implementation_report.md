# Phase 5 Terminology Normalization Implementation Report
## Interoperability & Code System Integration

**Implementation Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Branch:** realism  
**Implementation Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Previous Phase:** Phase 4 - Specialty Pathways & Equity Modeling (Completed)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 replaces legacy placeholder lists with code-first catalogs that drive the generator, ensuring every clinical element carries authoritative terminologies (ICD-10-CM, SNOMED CT, RxNorm, CVX, CPT, LOINC). Exports now surface codes alongside human-readable labels for downstream FHIR, HL7 v2, CSV, and VistA workflows. A regression run confirms analytics and migration reporting consume the new fields without breaking existing features.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Introduced `src/core/terminology_catalogs.py` capturing condition, medication, immunization, procedure, allergen, and lab catalogs with mapped codes and classes
- ✅ Refactored generator globals to derive from the catalogs and populate code fields on conditions, medications, immunizations, allergies, observations, and care plans (`src/core/synthetic_patient_generator.py`)
- ✅ Updated migration analytics with SDOH/care-pathway metrics (Phase 4) while emitting terminology-aware patient data
- ✅ Verified FHIR/HL7 exports leverage the new mappings and continue to validate successfully (Phase 5 regression run)
- ✅ Added tooling (`tools/generate_dashboard_summary.py`) and documentation updates describing the expanded analytics payload

## Detailed Changes

### Catalog Foundation
- Created Python catalogs covering:
  - **Conditions** (Hypertension, Diabetes, COPD, Cancer, etc.) with ICD-10-CM, SNOMED, and specialty categories
  - **Medications** (including cardiometabolic, oncology, behavioral, and precision therapies) with RxNorm, NDC, and therapeutic classes
  - **Immunizations** (CVX + SNOMED), **Allergens** (RxNorm/UNII), **Procedures** (CPT + SNOMED), and **Lab codes** (LOINC)
- Catalog entries intentionally mirror the generator’s display names to maintain backward compatibility while exposing codes.

### Generator Refactor
- Top-level constants in `src/core/synthetic_patient_generator.py` now reference the catalogs, eliminating hard-coded lists
- Condition records include `icd10_code`, `snomed_code`, and `condition_category`; medications include RxNorm/NDC/therapeutic class; immunizations carry CVX/SNOMED; allergies contain RxNorm/UNII
- Procedure and observation records set coded fields while retaining friendly names
- `TERMINOLOGY_MAPPINGS` dynamically builds from catalog definitions to power FHIR/HL7 encoding

### Interoperability & Analytics Enhancements
- FHIR Condition resources automatically include ICD-10 and SNOMED codes via updated mappings
- CSV exports (`conditions.csv`, `medications.csv`, `immunizations.csv`, `allergies.csv`, `procedures.csv`) now ship with code columns for interoperability verification
- Migration analytics reporting continues to surface SDOH and care-pathway metrics (Phase 4) and now reflects code-backed datasets

### Regression Validation
```bash
python3 -m src.core.synthetic_patient_generator --num-records 200 --output-dir output_phase5_regression --both --seed 101 --simulate-migration --batch-size 50 --migration-report migration_report_phase5.txt
```
- ✅ Generation, FHIR, HL7, and VistA exports successful with RxNorm/ICD/CVX/CPT metadata present
- ✅ Migration report shows 35.0% success (patient-based) plus SDOH and care-pathway sections, confirming analytics compatibility

## Agent Collaboration Summary
- **clinical-informatics-sme** selected the canonical codes for high-priority conditions, medications, immunizations, and procedures aligning with real clinical practice
- **healthcare-data-quality-engineer** ensured schema updates did not break CSV exports or analytics, validating regression runs and the new dashboard summary utility
- **healthcare-systems-architect** guided refactoring strategy so catalogs plug into existing generators without performance regression, and ensured interoperability outputs (FHIR/HL7/VistA) remained stable

## Next Steps
1. Extend catalogs as needed for additional specialties or customer-specific terminologies (e.g., oncology staging subsets).
2. Feed `dashboard_summary.json` into visualization tooling to expose equity and pathway metrics alongside new code coverage.
3. Establish catalog governance/versioning (UMLS release tracking, change logs) to keep terminology assets current.
