## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Medication Safety Violations - **FIXED**

**Before (Dangerous):**
```python
CONDITION_MEDICATIONS = {
    "Depression": ["Levothyroxine"],     # WRONG: Thyroid hormone for depression
    "Anxiety": ["Levothyroxine"],       # WRONG: Thyroid hormone for anxiety  
    "Cancer": ["Amoxicillin"],          # WRONG: Antibiotic for cancer
    "Flu": ["Amoxicillin"],             # WRONG: Antibiotic for viral infection
    "COVID-19": ["Amoxicillin"],        # WRONG: Antibiotic for viral infection
}
```

**After (Evidence-Based):**
```python
CONDITION_MEDICATIONS = {
    "Depression": {
        "ssri": ["Sertraline", "Escitalopram", "Fluoxetine"],
        "snri": ["Venlafaxine", "Duloxetine"],
        "atypical": ["Bupropion", "Mirtazapine"]
    },
    "Anxiety": {
        "ssri": ["Sertraline", "Paroxetine", "Escitalopram"],
        "benzodiazepines": ["Lorazepam", "Alprazolam"],
        "other": ["Buspirone"]
    },
    "COVID-19": {
        "antivirals": ["Paxlovid", "Remdesivir"],  # For high-risk patients
        "supportive": ["Acetaminophen", "Dexamethasone"]
    }
}
```

### 2. Death Cause Inadequacy - **EXPANDED**

**Before:**
- 14 generic death causes ("Heart Disease", "Cancer", "Stroke")
- No age stratification
- No ICD-10-CM coding
- No external cause categories

**After:**
- **200+ specific ICD-10-CM coded death causes**
- **Age-stratified mortality patterns**:
  - Neonatal (0-1): Congenital conditions, SIDS, birth complications
  - Pediatric (1-14): Accidents, childhood cancers, congenital diseases
  - Young Adult (15-34): Drug overdose, accidents, suicide, homicide
  - Middle-aged (35-64): Heart disease, cancer, liver disease
  - Elderly (65+): Cardiovascular disease, cancer, pneumonia, dementia
- **External cause categories** (V01-Y89) for accidents, suicide, homicide
- **Condition-specific mortality risk** with relative risk factors

### 3. Contraindication Checking - **IMPLEMENTED**

**New Safety Features:**
```python
MEDICATION_CONTRAINDICATIONS = {
    "Metformin": ["eGFR_less_than_30", "Severe_heart_failure", "Metabolic_acidosis"],
    "Lisinopril": ["Pregnancy", "Hyperkalemia", "Angioedema_history"],
    "Warfarin": ["Active_bleeding", "Severe_liver_disease", "Recent_surgery"],
    "Aspirin": ["Active_GI_bleeding", "Severe_asthma", "Age_under_16_with_viral_illness"]
}
```

**Clinical Decision Logic:**
- Age-based contraindications (e.g., aspirin in children with viral illness)
- Gender-based contraindications (e.g., pregnancy in women of childbearing age)
- Condition-based contraindications (kidney/liver disease)
- Automatic medication selection based on safety profile

---

## Detailed Implementation Changes

### 1. Medication Generation System Overhaul

**New Structure:**
- **Therapeutic Categories**: first_line, second_line, ssri, nsaids, etc.
- **Evidence-Based Selection**: Prioritizes first-line therapies
- **Safety Checking**: Contraindication validation before prescribing
- **Clinical Logic**: Condition-specific prescribing patterns

**Example Prescribing Logic:**
```python
# Diabetes - Always try Metformin first
if condition_name == "Diabetes":
    metformin_safe = not any(contra in contraindications for contra in MEDICATION_CONTRAINDICATIONS.get("Metformin", []))
    if metformin_safe:
        medications.append(create_medication_record(patient, condition, encounters, "Metformin", "first_line"))
    else:
        # Use second-line if Metformin contraindicated
        selected_med = select_safe_medication(treatment_guidelines["second_line"], contraindications)
```

### 2. Age-Stratified Death Cause System

**Implementation:**
```python
DEATH_CAUSES_BY_AGE = {
    (0, 1): [  # Neonatal/Infant
        {"icd10": "P07.30", "description": "Extremely low birth weight newborn", "weight": 15},
        {"icd10": "Q24.9", "description": "Congenital malformation of heart", "weight": 12},
        {"icd10": "R95", "description": "Sudden infant death syndrome", "weight": 5}
    ],
    (15, 34): [  # Young Adult  
        {"icd10": "X44.XXXA", "description": "Accidental poisoning by drugs", "weight": 20},
        {"icd10": "V43.52XA", "description": "Car passenger injured in collision", "weight": 18},
        {"icd10": "X83.8XXA", "description": "Intentional self-harm", "weight": 15}
    ],
    # ... additional age groups
}
```

**Condition-Specific Mortality:**
```python
CONDITION_MORTALITY_RISK = {
    "Cancer": {
        "relative_risk": 3.5,
        "likely_deaths": [
            {"icd10": "C80.1", "description": "Malignant neoplasm, unspecified", "weight": 40},
            {"icd10": "C78.00", "description": "Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung", "weight": 30}
        ]
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Death Certificate Data

**New Death Record Structure:**
```python
{
    "patient_id": "uuid",
    "death_date": "2024-01-15", 
    "age_at_death": 67,
    "primary_cause_code": "I21.9",
    "primary_cause_description": "Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified",
    "contributing_causes": "Diabetes; Hypertension; COPD",
    "manner_of_death": "Natural",  # Natural, Accident, Suicide, Homicide
    "death_certificate_type": "Standard"  # Standard vs Coroner
}
```

---

## Testing & Validation Results

### Test Data Generation (10 patients)
```bash
python3 -m src.core.synthetic_patient_generator --num-records 10 --output-dir phase1_test
```
