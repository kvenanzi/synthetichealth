# Phase 4 Clinical Realism Implementation Report
## Specialty Pathways & Advanced SDOH Equity Modeling

**Implementation Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Branch:** realism  
**Implementation Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Previous Phase:** Phase 3 - Advanced Clinical Logic (Completed)  
**Next Phase:** Phase 5 - Terminology Normalization & Interoperability Expansion

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 4 adds specialty-care realism and equity-aware social determinants to the synthetic generator. Cardiology, oncology, pulmonology, and behavioral health pathways now express longitudinal care milestones, staging, and outcome risks. Social context modeling has been upgraded with geographic deprivation scores, transportation access, language barriers, and care-gap tracking that dynamically influence disease probabilities and care plans.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ **Cardiology/Oncology/Pulmonology/Behavioral Health pathways** with staged care plans, dedicated lab panels, and complication modeling
- ✅ **Care-plan output table** documenting scheduled milestones, care-team composition, and quality metrics per patient
- ✅ **Advanced SDOH engine** generating deprivation indices, access-to-care scores, language/transportation barriers, and care gaps that feed condition probability adjustments
- ✅ **Expanded observation panels** (cardiology follow-up, tumor markers, pulmonary function, behavioral health assessments) with LOINC coding
- ✅ **Patient exports enhanced** with deprivation, access, and care-gap metadata for analytics and migration dashboards

## Detailed Enhancements

### Specialty Clinical Pathways
- Extended `CONDITION_COMPLEXITY_MODELS` with heart disease (NYHA/EF), COPD (GOLD staging), and major depressive disorder severity frameworks. Complications such as arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension, and suicidality now influence downstream risk and reporting.
- Added `SPECIALTY_CARE_PATHWAYS` to drive pathway generation for heart disease, cancer, COPD, and depression, capturing milestone scheduling and care-team context.
- Introduced `generate_care_plans()` to synthesize pathway milestones and persisted them via a new `care_plans` export (CSV/Parquet).

### Observation & Procedure Expansion
- Augmented `COMPREHENSIVE_LAB_PANELS` with cardiology follow-up, oncology tumor markers, behavioral health assessments, and pulmonary function panels, triggered by specialty conditions in `determine_lab_panels()`.
- Added numeric + textual observation outputs to preserve analytic fidelity while keeping schema consistent for CSV export.

### Advanced SDOH & Equity Modeling
- `calculate_sdoh_risk()` now invokes `generate_sdoh_context()` to assign community deprivation indices, care-access scores, transportation mode, language barriers, social support, and care gaps.
- `apply_sdoh_adjustments()` incorporates deprivation, access, and language factors via `SDOH_CONTEXT_MODIFIERS`, influencing cardiometabolic, oncologic, and behavioral condition probabilities.
- Patient metadata and exports now surface deprivation, access, support, and care-gap information enabling equity dashboards and gravity project alignment.

### Data Outputs
- `patients.csv` includes new SDOH metrics (`community_deprivation_index`, `access_to_care_score`, `transportation_access`, `sdoh_care_gaps`, etc.).
- New `care_plans.csv` table records condition-specific pathway stages with scheduled dates, care teams, and quality metrics (e.g., `beta_blocker_on_discharge`, `phq9_improved`).
- Specialty lab panels appear in `observations.csv` with LOINC codes and numeric values (`value_numeric`).

## Validation & Testing
```bash
python3 -m src.core.synthetic_patient_generator --num-records 10 --output-dir output_phase4_test --both --seed 7
```
- ✅ Generation succeeded with 337 observations, 35 procedures, and 10 care-plan rows across 10 patients.
- ✅ HL7/FHIR/VistA exports validated (20/20 HL7 messages valid).
- ✅ `care_plans.csv` present with cardiology, oncology, pulmonology, and behavioral milestones.
- ✅ Patient exports show deprivation indices (avg 0.42) and care gaps (e.g., `missed_colonoscopy`, `behavioral_health_followup`) informing condition prevalence.

## Agent Collaboration Summary
- **clinical-informatics-sme** guided specialty pathway selection, staging refinements, and quality metric alignment with ACC/AHA, NCCN, and APA guidelines.
- **healthcare-data-quality-engineer** ensured schema compatibility (string + numeric observation fields), added care-plan exports, and validated SDOH metrics for analytics readiness.
- **healthcare-systems-architect** advised on data-structure placement (`SPECIALTY_CARE_PATHWAYS`, new lab panels) to maintain generator performance and backward compatibility.

## Remaining Considerations
- Integrate specialty pathway outcomes into migration analytics dashboards (success/failure rates, care-gap metrics).
- Prepare for Phase 5 terminology refactor by mapping new specialty conditions and interventions to authoritative code sets.
- Expand equity modeling with regional datasets or configurable community profiles as part of future releases.

Phase 4 provides the specialty depth and equity context needed for realistic EHR migration rehearsals and quality analytics, setting the stage for terminology normalization in Phase 5.
