# Simulator Pivot: Remaining Work Plan

This checklist captures the outstanding tasks to complete the simulator-first refactor after the migration logic split.

## Phase 0 â€“ Migration Branch Finalization
- âœ… Run `python tools/prepare_migration_branch.py migration_snapshot` to stage migration modules.
- âœ… Create and push the long-lived `migration` branch containing the staged files and legacy docs.
- âœ… Remove migration flags/messages from `main` after downstream transition.

## Phase 1 â€“ Lifecycle Engine Enhancements
- âœ… Refactor remaining generator helpers (`generate_*`) into lifecycle-focused components under `src/core/lifecycle/`.
- âœ… Expand unit coverage for lifecycle pipelines as helper functions migrate out of the legacy generator.
- âœ… Introduce scenario configuration loaders, CLI selection, and lifecycle orchestrator wiring.
- âœ… Add smoke/unit tests for scenario loading and lifecycle orchestration to guard regressions.

## Phase 2 â€“ Terminology Platform
- âœ… Replace bespoke catalogs with normalized datasets under `data/terminology/`.
- âœ… Implement terminology loaders with filtering/caching support and connect them to scenario templates.
- ðŸ”„ Normalize official ICD-10, SNOMED CT, and RxNorm releases once source archives are available (importers added; keep scripts updated for future drops).
- ðŸ”„ Populate terminology datasets with comprehensive NLM/NCBI extracts (pending larger import tooling).
- ðŸ”„ Enrich terminology integration (e.g., map RxNorm CUIs to clinical scenarios, extend exporters) now that normalized tables exist for all vocabularies.
- ðŸ”„ Design a DuckDB terminology warehouse (schema, ingestion jobs) to ingest normalized ICD-10/LOINC/SNOMED/RxNorm tables; (build script and loader integration in progressâ€”extend to VSAC/UMLS + document usage in pipeline).
  - âœ… `tools/build_terminology_db.py` now stages VSAC value sets and UMLS concepts and documents the DuckDB rebuild cadence.
  - ðŸ”„ Author import utilities for VSAC/UMLS so normalized CSVs can be generated alongside the existing ICD-10/LOINC/SNOMED/RxNorm helpers.
- Expand FHIR/CSV exporters to consume the new terminology services.

## Phase 3 â€“ Clinical Realism & Validation
- Model workflow engines (referrals, lab cycles, care plan adherence) using probabilistic state machines.
- Rebuild validation to cover schema, terminology, and temporal consistency; ensure new tests run in CI.
- Add performance/snapshot tests to protect export stability and generator throughput.

## Phase 4 â€“ Docs, Tooling, and Release Prep
- Rewrite README and docs to focus on the simulator; link to the migration branch for legacy usage.
- Replace migration dashboards with clinical/SDOH analytics summaries and update utility scripts.
- Update CI pipelines, dependency manifests, and release notes to reflect the new architecture.

## Supporting Tasks
- Audit remaining modules for hard-coded migration references and remove or gate them.
- Capture design decisions in the implementation journal for transparency across phases.
- Plan beta milestones or internal releases once each phase reaches testing parity.
