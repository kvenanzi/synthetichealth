### Basic Migration Simulation

```python
from synthetic_patient_generator import MigrationSimulator, PatientRecord

# Create sample patients
patients = [generate_patient() for _ in range(100)]

# Initialize simulator with default configuration
simulator = MigrationSimulator()

# Run migration simulation
batch_result = simulator.simulate_staged_migration(
    patients, 
    batch_id="prod_migration_001"
)

# Check results
print(f"Success Rate: {batch_result.overall_success_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Quality Score: {batch_result.average_quality_score:.3f}")
print(f"Total Errors: {batch_result.total_errors}")
```

### Custom Configuration for Challenging Environments

```python
from synthetic_patient_generator import MigrationConfig

# Create custom configuration for high-risk scenarios
high_risk_config = MigrationConfig()
high_risk_config.stage_success_rates = {
    "extract": 0.85,    # Reduced from default 0.98
    "transform": 0.80,  # Reduced from default 0.95
    "validate": 0.75,   # Reduced from default 0.92
    "load": 0.70        # Reduced from default 0.90
}
high_risk_config.network_failure_rate = 0.15  # Increased from 0.05
high_risk_config.system_overload_rate = 0.10  # Increased from 0.03

# Run simulation with challenging configuration
simulator = MigrationSimulator(high_risk_config)
result = simulator.simulate_staged_migration(patients, "high_risk_test")
```

### Large-Scale Batch Processing

```python
# Process 1000 patients in batches of 50
total_patients = 1000
batch_size = 50
all_patients = [generate_patient() for _ in range(total_patients)]

simulator = MigrationSimulator()
batch_results = []

for i in range(0, total_patients, batch_size):
    batch_patients = all_patients[i:i+batch_size]
    batch_id = f"large_scale_batch_{i//batch_size + 1:03d}"
    
    result = simulator.simulate_staged_migration(batch_patients, batch_id)
    batch_results.append(result)
    
    print(f"Batch {batch_id}: {result.overall_success_rate:.1%} success")
```

### Comprehensive Analytics

```python
# Generate comprehensive analytics
analytics = simulator.get_migration_analytics()

# Executive summary
summary = analytics["summary"]
print(f"Total Patients: {summary['total_patients']}")
print(f"Overall Success: {summary['overall_success_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Average Quality: {summary['average_quality_score']:.4f}")

# Stage performance analysis
for stage, stats in analytics["stage_performance"].items():
    print(f"{stage}: {stats['success_rate']:.1%} success, {stats['average_duration']:.1f}s")

# Export detailed report
simulator.export_migration_report("migration_analysis_report.txt")

## Best Practices

### For Healthcare Organizations
1. **Start Small**: Begin with small batches (50-100 patients) to validate configuration
2. **Incremental Testing**: Gradually increase batch sizes based on initial results
3. **Quality Monitoring**: Set quality score thresholds and monitor degradation patterns
4. **Error Analysis**: Regularly review failure types and implement targeted improvements

### For Migration Teams
1. **Configuration Tuning**: Adjust success rates based on actual system performance
2. **Staging Environment**: Use simulator to validate staging environment readiness
3. **Rollback Planning**: Use failure scenarios to test rollback procedures
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed logs of simulation results and configurations

### For Quality Assurance
1. **Baseline Establishment**: Establish quality baselines before migration
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: Set acceptable quality degradation limits
3. **Validation Testing**: Use simulator to test data validation rules
4. **Compliance Verification**: Ensure HIPAA and regulatory compliance throughout migration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Low Success Rates
- **Symptoms**: Overall success rate below 80%
- **Solutions**: Reduce batch sizes, implement retry logic, check network stability

#### High Quality Degradation
- **Symptoms**: Average quality score below 0.85
- **Solutions**: Review transformation rules, add validation checkpoints, improve error handling

#### Performance Issues
- **Symptoms**: Long processing times, resource exhaustion errors
- **Solutions**: Optimize batch sizes, implement parallel processing, monitor system resources

#### Network-Related Failures
- **Symptoms**: High network timeout rates
- **Solutions**: Implement connection pooling, add retry mechanisms, check network infrastructure

## Advanced Features

### Custom Error Injection
```python
# Create custom failure scenario
custom_config = MigrationConfig()
custom_config.network_failure_rate = 0.20  # 20% network failures
custom_config.data_corruption_rate = 0.10  # 10% data corruption

simulator = MigrationSimulator(custom_config)
```

### Quality Recovery Simulation
```python
# Simulate quality improvement processes
config = MigrationConfig()
config.quality_degradation_per_success = -0.01  # Negative = quality improvement
```

### Multi-Strategy Testing
```python
# Test different migration strategies
strategies = ["staged", "big_bang", "parallel"]
results = {}

for strategy in strategies:
    result = simulator.simulate_staged_migration(patients, 
                                               migration_strategy=strategy)
    results[strategy] = result.overall_success_rate
```

The MigrationSimulator integrates seamlessly with:
- **VistA Export Tools**: Use real VistA data exports for more accurate simulation
- **Oracle Health APIs**: Validate against actual target system requirements
- **Monitoring Systems**: Export metrics to existing monitoring infrastructure
